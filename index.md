## About Me

I am an incoming Ph.D. student at [xML LAB](https://sites.google.com/view/xml-nus) @ National University of Singapore, advised by professor [Xinchao Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=w69Buq0AAAAJ). Before joining the LV Lab, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Communication Engineering from Soochow University and my Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from the National University of Singapore. My current research interests focus on Efficient Generative AI.

## Research Interests

- **Efficient AI:** model compression, model acceleration, distributed computing.
- **Generative Model:** diffusion models, large language models, mutimodal models.
- **Low-level Vision:** computational photography, super-resolution.

## News
- **[Feb. 2025]** One first-auther paper about efficient visual auto-regressive modeling is accepted to CVPR 2025.
- **[Sep. 2024]** One first-auther paper about distributed acceleration of diffusion model is accepted to NeurIPS 2024.
- **[Sep. 2024]** One first-auther paper about SAM compression is accepted to NeurIPS 2024.
- **[April. 2024]** One first-auther paper about learnable ISP is accepted to IJCAI 2024.
